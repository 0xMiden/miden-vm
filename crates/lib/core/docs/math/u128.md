| Procedure | Description |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| overflowing_add | Performs addition of two unsigned 128 bit integers preserving the overflow.<br />The input values are assumed to be represented using 32 bit limbs, but this is not checked.<br />Stack transition is as follows:<br />[b_ll, b_ml, b_mh, b_hh, a_ll, a_ml, a_mh, a_hh, ...] -> [overflow, c_ll, c_ml, c_mh, c_hh, ...], where c = (a + b) % 2^128<br /> |
| wrapping_add | Performs addition of two unsigned 128 bit integers discarding the overflow.<br />The input values are assumed to be represented using 32 bit limbs, but this is not checked.<br />Stack transition is as follows:<br />[b_ll, b_ml, b_mh, b_hh, a_ll, a_ml, a_mh, a_hh, ...] -> [c_ll, c_ml, c_mh, c_hh, ...], where c = (a + b) % 2^128<br /> |
| overflowing_sub | Performs subtraction of two unsigned 128 bit integers preserving the underflow.<br />The input values are assumed to be represented using 32 bit limbs, but this is not checked.<br />Stack transition is as follows:<br />[b_ll, b_ml, b_mh, b_hh, a_ll, a_ml, a_mh, a_hh, ...] -> [underflow, c_ll, c_ml, c_mh, c_hh, ...], where c = (a - b) % 2^128<br /> |
| wrapping_sub | Performs subtraction of two unsigned 128 bit integers discarding the underflow.<br />The input values are assumed to be represented using 32 bit limbs, but this is not checked.<br />Stack transition is as follows:<br />[b_ll, b_ml, b_mh, b_hh, a_ll, a_ml, a_mh, a_hh, ...] -> [c_ll, c_ml, c_mh, c_hh, ...], where c = (a - b) % 2^128<br /> |
| overflowing_mul | Performs multiplication of two unsigned 128 bit integers preserving the overflow.<br />The input values are assumed to be represented using 32 bit limbs, but this is not checked.<br />Stack transition is as follows:<br />[b_ll, b_ml, b_mh, b_hh, a_ll, a_ml, a_mh, a_hh, ...] -> [overflow, c_ll, c_ml, c_mh, c_hh, ...], where c = (a * b) % 2^128<br /><br />Schoolbook multiplication (LE layout with low limbs on top):<br /><br />a_ll    a_ml    a_mh    a_hh<br />x b_ll    b_ml    b_mh    b_hh<br />-------------------------------------------<br />(position)     0       1       2       3       4 (overflow)<br /><br />Partial products contributing to each position:<br />c_ll (pos 0): a_ll*b_ll<br />c_ml (pos 1): a_ml*b_ll + a_ll*b_ml + carries from pos 0<br />c_mh (pos 2): a_mh*b_ll + a_ml*b_ml + a_ll*b_mh + carries from pos 1<br />c_hh (pos 3): a_hh*b_ll + a_mh*b_ml + a_ml*b_mh + a_ll*b_hh + carries from pos 2<br />overflow: anything that goes into pos 4+<br /> |
| wrapping_mul | Performs multiplication of two unsigned 128 bit integers discarding the overflow.<br />The input values are assumed to be represented using 32 bit limbs, but this is not checked.<br />Stack transition is as follows:<br />[b_ll, b_ml, b_mh, b_hh, a_ll, a_ml, a_mh, a_hh, ...] -> [c_ll, c_ml, c_mh, c_hh, ...], where c = (a * b) % 2^128<br /><br />Uses schoolbook multiplication with u32wrapping_madd for products contributing to c_hh<br />since overflow there doesn't affect the result.<br /> |
