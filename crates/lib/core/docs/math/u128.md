| Procedure | Description |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| overflowing_add | Performs addition of two unsigned 128 bit integers preserving the overflow.<br />The input values are assumed to be represented using 32 bit limbs, but this is not checked.<br />Stack transition is as follows:<br />[bhh, bmh, bml, bll, ahh, amh, aml, all, ...] -> [overflowing_flag, chh, cmh, cml, cll, ...], where c = (a + b) % 2^128<br /> |
| wrapping_add | Performs addition of two unsigned 128 bit integers discarding the overflow.<br />The input values are assumed to be represented using 32 bit limbs, but this is not checked.<br />Stack transition is as follows:<br />[bhh, bmh, bml, bll, ahh, amh, aml, all, ...] -> [chh, cmh, cml, cll, ...], where c = (a + b) % 2^128<br /> |
| overflowing_sub | Performs subtraction of two unsigned 128 bit integers preserving the underflow.<br />The input values are assumed to be represented using 32 bit limbs, but this is not checked.<br />Stack transition is as follows:<br />[bhh, bmh, bml, bll, ahh, amh, aml, all, ...] -> [underflowing_flag, chh, cmh, cml, cll, ...], where c = (a - b) % 2^128<br /> |
| wrapping_sub | Performs subtraction of two unsigned 128 bit integers discarding the underflow.<br />The input values are assumed to be represented using 32 bit limbs, but this is not checked.<br />Stack transition is as follows:<br />[bhh, bmh, bml, bll, ahh, amh, aml, all, ...] -> [chh, cmh, cml, cll, ...], where c = (a - b) % 2^128<br /> |
| overflowing_mul | Performs multiplication of two unsigned 128 bit integers preserving the overflow.<br />The input values are assumed to be represented using 32 bit limbs, but this is not checked.<br />Stack transition is as follows:<br />[bhh, bmh, bml, bll, ahh, amh, aml, all, ...] -> [overflowing_flag, chh, cmh, cml, cll, ...], where c = (a * b) % 2^128<br /> |
| wrapping_mul | Performs multiplication of two unsigned 128 bit integers discarding the overflow.<br />The input values are assumed to be represented using 32 bit limbs, but this is not checked.<br />Stack transition is as follows:<br />[bhh, bmh, bml, bll, ahh, amh, aml, all, ...] -> [chh, cmh, cml, cll, ...], where c = (a * b) % 2^128<br /> |
