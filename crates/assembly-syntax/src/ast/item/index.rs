/// Uniquely identifies an item in a set of [crate::ast::Module]

/// graph. The index uniquely identifies that item in the graph, and provides a unique,
/// copyable, machine-word sized handle that can be trivially stored, passed around, and later used
/// to perform constant-complexity operations against that item.
///
/// <div class="warning">
/// As a result of this being just an index into a specific instance of a [super::ModuleGraph],
/// it does not provide any guarantees about uniqueness or stability when the same module is stored
/// in multiple graphs - each graph may assign it a unique index. You must ensure that you do not
/// store these indices and attempt to use them with just any module graph - it is only valid with
/// the one it was assigned from.
/// </div>
///
/// In addition to the linker's module graph, these indices are also used with an instance of a
/// `MastForestBuilder`. This is because the linker and `MastForestBuilder` instances
/// are paired, i.e. the linker stores the syntax trees and call graph analysis for a program, while
/// the `MastForestBuilder` caches the compiled [crate::Procedure]s for the same program, as
/// derived from the corresponding graph.
///
/// This is intended for use when we are doing global inter-procedural analysis on a (possibly
/// growable) set of modules. It is expected that the index of a module in the set, as well as the
/// index of an item in a module, are stable once allocated in the graph. The set of modules and
/// items can grow, as long as growing the set only allocates unused identifiers.
