//! Closure-based builder traits for the LogUp lookup-argument API.
//!
//! The lookup-air refactor introduces the trait stack that sits on top of
//! `LookupAir`:
//!
//! - [`LookupBuilder`] — the top-level handle mirroring the subset of `LiftedAirBuilder` a lookup
//!   author actually needs (trace access plus per-column scoping). It hides `assert_*` / `when_*` /
//!   permutation plumbing and does not expose the verifier challenges.
//! - [`LookupColumn`] — per-column handle returned by [`LookupBuilder::column`]. It owns the
//!   boundary between groups; its only job is to open a group (either the simple path or the
//!   cached-encoding dual path).
//! - [`LookupGroup`] — the simple, challenge-free interaction API used by bus authors. Every method
//!   here takes a `LookupMessage`; the enclosing adapter is responsible for encoding it under α + Σ
//!   βⁱ · payload.
//! - [`LookupBatch`] — a short-lived handle returned inside [`LookupGroup::batch`]. Represents a
//!   set of simultaneous interactions that share the outer group's flag.
//! - [`LookupGroup`] also exposes optional encoding primitives (`bus_prefix`, `beta_powers`,
//!   `insert_encoded`) for the cached-encoding path. Default implementations panic; only the
//!   constraint-path adapter overrides them with real bodies.
//!
//! No adapter impls live in this file — they arrive in Task #3 (constraint
//! path) and Task #4 (prover path). The bounds here are therefore chosen
//! so that both adapters can satisfy them: the constraint-path adapter
//! forwards to an inner `LiftedAirBuilder` (so the associated types ride
//! on `AB::Expr` / `AB::ExprEF` / etc.), while the prover-path adapter
//! instantiates them with the concrete `F` / `EF` field types directly.

// Task #6 (block-hash queue port) lands the first live

/// The trace-reading handle handed to a [`super::LookupAir`] implementation.
///
/// `LookupBuilder` deliberately mirrors the subset of `LiftedAirBuilder`'s
/// associated types needed to read `main`, `periodic_values`, and
/// `public_values`. It is **not** a sub-trait of `AirBuilder`: the constraint
/// emission surface (`assert_zero` / `when_first_row` / …) and the
/// permutation column plumbing stay hidden, which keeps the simple lookup
/// path free of challenge access.
///
/// Implementors must not shortcut the per-column scoping: a [`LookupAir`]
/// author that opens `n` columns must issue exactly `n` calls to
/// [`LookupBuilder::column`], matching [`super::LookupAir::num_columns`].
///
/// ## Associated-type layout
///
/// The base-field stack (`F`, `Expr`, `Var`) and extension-field stack
/// (`EF`, `ExprEF`, `VarEF`) mirror the upstream `AirBuilder` /
/// `ExtensionBuilder` split one-for-one; `Algebra<Var>` on `Expr` lets the
/// lookup author multiply main-trace variables with arbitrary expressions
/// without crossing trait boundaries. `PeriodicVar` / `PublicVar` /
/// `MainWindow` come from `PeriodicAirBuilder` / `AirBuilder` respectively
/// and are passed through the adapter unchanged.
///
/// The per-column handle is a generic associated type
/// ([`Self::Column`](Self::Column)) so that each `column(...)` call can
/// borrow from `self` without outliving the closure. Its bound pins the
/// expression and extension-variable types to keep them in sync with the
