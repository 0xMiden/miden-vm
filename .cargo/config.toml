# xclippy: Enforces strict linting to prevent redundant clones and other issues
#
# Due to Cargo alias limitations with feature flags, the lint flags are applied
# at call-site rather than in the alias itself. This ensures consistent behavior
# across Makefile and CI.
#
# Enforced lint flags (applied in Makefile and CI):
# - -Dwarnings: Treat all warnings as errors
# - -Dclippy::all: Enable all clippy lints
# - -Wclippy::redundant_clone: Warn on redundant clones (prevents re-introduction of this PR's fixes)
