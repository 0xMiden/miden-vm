# Miden precompiles
This crate is the home for concrete deferred precompile implementations used by Miden VM.

The generic deferred-computation framework stays in [`miden-core`](../core), under `miden_core::deferred`: the node/DAG data model, the `Precompile` trait, the `PrecompileRegistry`, deferred state, and wire validation. This crate builds on that framework and provides the concrete precompiles that programs can defer their semantic checks to, exposing them through a single `registry()` constructor.

## Usage
This crate exposes a `registry()` function that returns a `miden_core::deferred::PrecompileRegistry` — the registry that routes deferred tags to their owning precompile — populated with the precompiles this crate provides.

## Crate features
Miden precompiles can be compiled with the following features:

* `std` - enabled by default and relies on the Rust standard library.
* `no_std` does not rely on the Rust standard library and enables compilation to WebAssembly.
    * Only the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and `wasm32-wasip1` targets are officially supported.

To compile with `no_std`, disable default features via `--no-default-features` flag.
