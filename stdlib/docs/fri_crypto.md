| verify_remainder_64 | Given remainder codeword with 64 evaluations ( as starting memory address on stack ), this routine attempts to<br /><br />probabilistically verify remainder following the technique described in https://github.com/0xPolygonMiden/miden-vm/issues/592<br /><br />and an optimization of how to efficiently compute Î² in https://github.com/0xPolygonMiden/miden-vm/pull/644#pullrequestreview-1265141094<br /><br />Expected stack state<br /><br />[mem_ptr, ...]<br /><br />A few assumptions about mem_ptr<br /><br />- mem_ptr should be absolute memory address of the beginning of remainder codeword<br /><br />- Each evaluation is 2 field elements wide because they belong to quadratic extension field over F_p \| p = 2^64 - 2^32 + 1<br /><br />- Meaning each memory address will hold two consecutive evaluations<br /><br />- Words ( four field elements ), in memory, are laid out in this order (a1_0, a1_0, a0_1, a0_0)<br /><br />- That means (a0_1, a0_0) -> first evaluation and (a1_1, a1_0) -> next evaluation<br /><br />- Next 31 memory addresses should be holding remaining 62 evaluations<br /><br />- If mem_ptr holds (a1_0, a1_0, a0_1, a0_0), then mem_ptr + 1, must hold (a3_0, a3_0, a2_1, a2_0)<br /><br />- That way, mem_ptr + 31 should be holding (a63_0, a63_0, a62_1, a62_0)<br /><br />Final stack looks like<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />If remainder verification fails, execution of the program stops. |
