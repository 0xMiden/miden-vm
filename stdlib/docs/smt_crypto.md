| ----------- | ------------- |
| get |  Pushes the leaf value at K to the stack<br /><br /> Each leaf in the tree is equal to H = hash([K, V]), where K and V are Words corresponding<br /> to the uncompacted keys and value, respectively.<br /> To retrieve a given leaf H, the compacted key and depth (each represented by a single field <br /> element) are added to the advice tape and consumed by the procedure.<br /><br /> The only soundness checks performed in the 'get' and 'update' procedures are to verify that<br /> K and V hash to the the claimed retrieved leaf in the compacted tree. Soundness checks<br /> ensuring that H is located at the correct leaf node are performed at the time of insertion<br /> in the 'insert' procedure.<br /><br /> In the example below, the bit representation of the compacted keys are 000 for a, and 001<br /> for b, which match the first 3 bits of each Word key used to generate H.<br /><br />           o<br />          /<br />         o<br />        /<br />       o<br />      / \<br />     a   b<br /><br /> vars:<br /> R: trie root<br /> K: trie key<br /> V: leaf value<br /><br /> in:  [R, K, ...]<br /> out: [V, R, K, ...] |
| set |  Set the leaf value at K and push the new root R' to the stack <br /><br /> Two scenarios:<br /> 1. Empty value at key<br /> 2. Existing value at key<br /><br /> vars:<br /> R: old trie root<br /> R': new trie root<br /> K: new trie key<br /> V: new leaf value<br /><br /> in:  [R, K, V ...]<br /> out: [R', V, K, ...] |
