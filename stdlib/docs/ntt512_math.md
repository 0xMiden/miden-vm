| Procedure | Description |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| forward.128 |  Applies forward NTT on a vector of length 512, where each element ∈ Zp \| p = 2^64 − 2^32 + 1,<br /> producing elements in frequency domain in bit-reversed order.<br /><br /> Expected stack state as input:<br /><br /> [addr0, addr1, addr2, addr3, ... , addr126, addr127] \| 128 absolute memory addresses<br /><br /> Note, addr{i} is the absolute memory address of i-th word of input vector V s.t.<br /> each word consists of four consecutive field elements in vector of length 512.<br /><br /> Meaning addr{i} holds values V[(i << 2) .. ((i+1) << 2)] \| i ∈ [0, 128)<br /><br /> After applying NTT, bit-reversed order vector is returned back as 128 absolute memory<br /> addresses on stack, as input was provided.<br /><br /> [addr0', addr1', addr2', addr3', ... , addr126', addr127'] \| 128 absolute memory addresses<br /><br /> Note, input memory allocation is not mutated, instead output is stored in different memory allocation. |
| backward.128 |  Applies inverse NTT on a vector of length 512, where each element ∈ Zp \| p = 2^64 − 2^32 + 1,<br /> producing elements in time domain in standard order, while input vector is expected to be in <br /> bit-reversed order.<br /><br /> Expected stack state as input:<br /><br /> [addr0, addr1, addr2, addr3, ... , addr126, addr127] \| 128 absolute memory addresses<br /><br /> Note, addr{i} is the absolute memory address of i-th word of input vector V s.t.<br /> each word consists of four consecutive field elements in vector of length 512.<br /><br /> Meaning addr{i} holds values V[(i << 2) .. ((i+1) << 2)] \| i ∈ [0, 128)<br /><br /> After applying iNTT, normal order vector is returned back as 128 absolute memory<br /> addresses on stack, as input was provided.<br /><br /> [addr0', addr1', addr2', addr3', ... , addr126', addr127'] \| 128 absolute memory addresses<br /><br /> Note, input memory allocation is not mutated, instead output is stored in different memory allocation. |
