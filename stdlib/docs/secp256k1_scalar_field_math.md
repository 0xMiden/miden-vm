## std::math::secp256k1_scalar_field
| Procedure | Description |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| mul.2 |  Given two 256 -bit numbers ( elements belonging to secp256k1 scalar field ) on stack, <br /> where each number is represented in radix-2^32 form ( i.e. each number having eight<br /> 32 -bit limbs ), following function computes modular multiplication of those two <br /> operands, computing 256 -bit result, which belongs to secp256k1 scalar field.<br /><br /> Stack expected as below, holding input<br /><br /> [a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, b0, b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, ...] \| a[0..8], b[0..8] are 256 -bit numbers<br /><br /> After finishing execution of this function, stack should look like<br /><br /> [c0, c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, c7, ...] \| c[0..8] is a 256 -bit number<br /><br /> Note, for computing modular multiplication of a[0..8] & b[0..8],<br /> school book multiplication equipped with Montgomery reduction technique<br /> is used, which is why a[0..8], b[0..8] are expected to be in Montgomery form,<br /> while computed c[0..8] will also be in Montgomery form.<br /><br /> See https://github.com/itzmeanjan/secp256k1/blob/6e5e654823a073add7d62b21ed88e9de9bb06869/field/scalar_field_utils.py#L101-L225 |
