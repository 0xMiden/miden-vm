| Procedure | Description |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| compute_deep_composition_polynomial_queries | Computes the DEEP composition polynomial FRI queries.<br /><br />This procedures iterates over all FRI query indices stored in memory at `query_ptr` in<br />a word-aligned and overwrites each word with `[eval0, eval1, index, poe]` where:<br /><br />1. `index` is the FRI query index,<br />2. `poe := g^index`, with `g` being the evaluation domain generator,<br />3. `eval := (eval0, eval1)` is the computed DEEP composition polynomial query.<br /><br />Inputs:  [Y, query_ptr, query_end_ptr, W, query_ptr]<br />Outputs: []<br /><br />where:<br /><br />1. `Y` is a garbage word,<br />2. `query_ptr` is a pointer to the memory region from where the query indices will be fetched<br />and to where the computed FRI queries will be stored in a word-aligned manner,<br />3. `query_end_ptr` is a memory pointer used to indicate the end of the memory region used in<br />storing the computed FRI queries,<br />4. `W` is the word `[q_z_0, q_z_1, q_gz_0, q_gz_1]` where `q_z = (q_z_0, q_z_1)` and<br />`q_gz = (q_gz_0, q_gz_1)` represent the constant terms across all FRI queries computations.<br /> |
