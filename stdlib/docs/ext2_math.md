| Procedure | Description |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| mul | Given a stack with initial configuration given by [a1,a0,b1,b0,...] where a = (a0,a1) and<br /><br />b = (b0,b1) represent elements in the extension field of degree 2, the procedure outputs the<br /><br />product c = (c1,c0) where c0 = a0b0 - 2(a1b1) and c1 = (a0 + a1)(b0 + b1) - a0b0 |
| mul_base | Given a stack with initial configuration given by [x,a1,a0,...] where a = (a0,a1) is an element<br /><br />in the field extension and x is an element of the base field, this procedure computes the multiplication<br /><br />of x, when looked at as (x,0), with a in the extension field. The output is [xa1,xa0,...] |
| add | Given a stack in the following initial configuration [a1,a0,b1,b0,...] the following<br /><br />procedure computes [a1+b1,a0+b0,...] |
| sub | Given a stack in the following initial configuration [a1,a0,b1,b0,...] the following<br /><br />procedure computes [a1-b1,a0-b0,...] |
| inv | Given an invertible quadratic extension field element on stack, this routine computes<br /><br />multiplicative inverse of that element, using non-deterministic technique ( i.e. takes help<br /><br />of advice provider ). Just to ensure that non-deterministic computation resulted in corrected value,<br /><br />it multiplies input operand with computed output, over quadratic extension field which must produce<br /><br />multiplicative identity (1, 0) of quadratic extension field.<br /><br />Expected input stack<br /><br />[a1, a0, ...] \| a = (a0, a1) ∈ Quadratic extension field over F_q, q = 2^64 - 2^32 + 1<br /><br />Expected output stack<br /><br />[a'1, a'0, ...] \| a' = (a'0, a'1) ∈ Quadratic extension field over F_q, q = 2^64 - 2^32 + 1<br /><br />Following is what is checked after reading result of computation, performed outside of VM<br /><br />a  = (a0, a1)<br /><br />a' = (a'0, a'1) ( = a ^ -1 )<br /><br />b  = a * a' ( mod P ) \| P = irreducible polynomial x^2 - x + 2 over F_q, q = 2^64 - 2^32 + 1<br /><br />assert b  = (1, 0) \| (1, 0) is the multiplicative identity of extension field |
