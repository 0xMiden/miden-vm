# Digital signatures
Namespace `std::crypto::dsa` contains a set of  digital signature schemes supported by default in the Miden VM. Currently, these schemes are:

* `RPO Falcon512`: a variant of the [Falcon](https://falcon-sign.info/) signature scheme.

## RPO Falcon512

Module `std::crypto::dsa::rpo_falcon512` contains procedures for verifying `RPO Falcon512` signatures. These signatures differ from the standard Falcon signatures in that instead of using `SHAKE256` hash function in the *hash-to-point* algorithm we use `RPO256`. This makes the signature more efficient to verify in the Miden VM.

The module exposes the following procedures:

| Procedure   | Description |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| verify      | Verifies a signature against a public key and a message. The procedure gets as inputs the hash of the public key and the hash of the message via the operand stack. The signature is expected to be provided via the advice provider.<br /><br />The signature is valid if and only if the procedure returns.<br /><br />Stack inputs: `[PK, MSG, ...]`<br />Advice stack inputs: `[SIGNATURE]`<br />Outputs: `[...]`<br /><br />Where `PK` is the hash of the public key and `MSG` is the hash of the message, and `SIGNATURE` is the signature being verified. Both hashes are expected to be computed using `RPO` hash function.<br /><br />|
