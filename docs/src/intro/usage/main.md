# Usage
Before you can use Miden VM, you'll need to make sure you have Rust [installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Miden VM v0.6 requires Rust version **1.67** or later.

Miden VM consists of several crates, each of which exposes a small set of functionality. The most notable of these crates are:
* [miden-processor](https://crates.io/crates/miden-processor), which can be used to execute Miden VM programs.
* [miden-prover](https://crates.io/crates/miden-prover), which can be used to execute Miden VM programs and generate proofs of their execution.
* [miden-verifier](https://crates.io/crates/miden-verifier), which can be used to verify proofs of program execution generated by Miden VM prover.

The above functionality is also exposed via the single [miden](https://crates.io/crates/miden) crate, which also provides a CLI interface for interacting with Miden VM.
