name: 'Release-plz Action'
description: 'Runs release-plz with dry-run support and workflow synchronization

This action provides both dry-run and production release modes while keeping
core logic synchronized between workflows:

- Dry-run mode: Tests release-plz configuration without publishing
- Production mode: Actually publishes releases and bumps versions

The shared implementation ensures divergence is impossible between workflows.'
